## Instructions for running project 2 code


### Section 1: Particle filter SLAM
Directory structure:
```
/code
    load_data.py
    configs.py
    particle_slam.py
    pr2_utils.py
    preprocess.py
    texture_map2.py

/data
    
```
The above structure must be maintained in order to run properly. The command to run this section
 is 'python particle_slam.py'. The data is loaded from the /data directory and the data file should be exactly as provided in the original project directory.


NOTE: Dataset 21 has been hardcoded into the files. 

 ## Section 2: Texture mapping
- Run this using 'python texture_map2.py'. This will output a texture map at the end.
